    "# Are Lotter tickets worth the money spent on them\n",
    "\n",
    "The lottery ticket is often viewed as a easiest way to get rich quick. The odds of a lottery ticket paying up the big prize at the end are often miniscule especially when you consider the huge sample space of outcomes possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lottery tickets similar to gambling has the potential to develop from leisure into an addictable activity and have serious financial consequences on the personal lives of those addicted to buying lottery tickets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently medical institutions combating gambling addictions have turned to using technology to help educate their patients on the reality behind lottery odds. They are using mobile apps to allow addicts to estimate their chances at winning the big prize and realize how low their chances truly are.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project attempts to create a probabilistic determination of lottery odds using real world data. Historical data is available from 1982 to 2018 for the [Lotto 6/49](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49), which is one of the national lottery schemes in Canada, let us try and compute the probability of a single ticket or mulitple tickets being able to win the grand prize."
